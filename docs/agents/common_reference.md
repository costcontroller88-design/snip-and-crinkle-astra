# Rules card: full text (all agents)

Full rule text, moved here verbatim from the v3.6 agent file (rollback tag `agents-v3.6-pre-diet`) when the agent files went on a diet in v3.7. The agent file keeps ≤10 short core rules; every original rule is still here.
Open it only when the job touches a topic named in the agent file.

## Rules card, original (every agent)
- **Channel:** Snip & Crinkle, wordless Made-for-Kids cartoons for ages 2-6: Snip (lilac bunny, blue star tee, curious), Crinkle (caramel bear, yellow striped scarf, kind), Pip (little yellow duckling). A grown-up appears only as a paper arm and hand, and handles anything dangerous.
- **Never:** words on screen except numerals, "?" and ✓/✗ (drawn as icons); voices or talking sounds; third-party characters, music, sound files, logos, brands or branded food; anything scary, violent, gross or mean; a dangerous action a child could copy; laughing at whoever is sad, unsure or wrong.
- **Always real:** every action has a visible cause; real physics and reach; nobody climbs.
- **Comedy:** a gag is a safe surprise (set-up, pause, break, a grin or laugh, a held reaction) from a character trait; charm is not a gag; never at the one who is sad or wrong. Standard: `docs/COMEDY_PLAYBOOK.md` (your section is named in your file).
- **Files by convention** (a brief names only the episode): plan `reviews/epNN_plan.md` (a Short alone: `reviews/epNN_short_plan.md`); safety `reviews/epNN_safety.md`; blind reviews `reviews/epNN_blind_rK.md` and `reviews/epNN_storyboard_blind_sbK.md` (the reviewer writes next to its neutral copy; the Lead moves and renames); upload sheet `reviews/<video>_upload.md`; key sheet `reviews/<video>_keys.png`; code `episodes/epNN_<slug>.py`; props `episodes/props_<slug>.py`; Shorts `episodes/epNN_short_story.py`, `episodes/epNN_short_transform.py`; renders `output/`; the owner's copies `Videos/`.
- **Know the toolkit from `docs/TOOLKIT.md`** and module docstrings (`sed -n 1,45p <file>`), not by reading source you aren't changing. Never re-read a file you already read.
- **Shell:** separators are `echo ---`, never `echo ===` (zsh). Module paths come from `docs/TOOLKIT.md`, never guessed.
- **Scope:** only your job; shared modules only if the brief says so; commit only if the brief says so; never touch YouTube.
- **Pictures:** view sheets and stills at about 1,600 px wide; full-size frames only for a specific check.
- **Evidence or it isn't checked:** every check you report carries a still's path or a number measured by a script; otherwise write "not checked". Estimates are labelled as estimates.
- **Budget:** your file gives a tool-call budget per job; at the budget, stop and report what is done and what is left (a hard stop, `maxTurns`, follows soon after). Work in parallel tool calls where you can.
- **Own mistakes:** if you broke a rule, skipped a check, or find the plan or brief you got was wrong, add one line "Mistakes:" to your return; the Lead logs it for retraining.
- **Stop when the job is done.** Return ≤150 words: the result and decision first, then open problems and file paths; no account of your process.
